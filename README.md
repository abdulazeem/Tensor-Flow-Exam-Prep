# Tensor-Flow-Developer-Exam-Practice

The Python Notebooks in this folder were created to practice for the Tensor Flow certification exam, which constitutes of the following four areas:

### 1) Basic Deep Neural Networks in TensorFlow
### 2) Convolutional Neural Networks for Images in TensorFlow
### 3) Natural Language Processing with CNN, LSTM, GRU in TensorFlow
### 4) Sequnces and Time Series Forecasting with CNN, LSTM Units in TensorFlow
